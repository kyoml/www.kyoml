# Strings

## Simple strings

Simple strings are the most basic kind of text. They start and end with single quotes `'`


<pre class="ace-editor">

foo = 'a simple string'

</pre>

## Complex strings

Complex strings are similar to simple strings, except they use double quotes `"` and support string interpolation

<pre class="ace-editor">

greeting = "hello"
object = "world"
sentence = "${greeting} ${world}"

</pre>
